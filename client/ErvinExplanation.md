My general approach:

Backend:
- Validate inputs for the API calls at the boundary. In this case I validated inputs using zod schemas.
This ensures that any clients of the API either input/receive the correct request/response shape or we throw a helpful error message.
- Handle errors and return appropriate error codes with helpful error messages for debugging.
- Add a error handler class per error type for context-specific errors - e.g. DatabaseError class can indicate that the error
occurred due to a database operation and may include details like which table/rows the error occurred for.

Frontend:
- Manage success/error states after api calls. On error, display a helpful error message via a toast.
- Reload the list of insights after each update operation. Ideally would manage through a standard library like ReactQuery
but in this case I just used a combination of useEffect and useMemo for caching and reactivity.
- Some helpful UI elements were added to make user experience better. Filters/sort capability to make list management easier for the user.

Testing:
- Add comprehensive unit tests for (most) of the files.
- Add integration tests in the backend to verify database interactions.
